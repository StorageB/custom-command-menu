Version 10

What's new in this version:

•  Typing --- or ~~~ in the name field creates a separator line in the menu.
•  Adding text after --- or ~~~ creates a labeled separator.
•  An "Insert new" option was added to the row menu (alongside "Duplicate" and "Delete") to insert a new row below an existing one.
•  A maximize button was added to the preferences window, and the default window size has been changed to better suit a list of commands.
•  A notification will now appear when the maximum number of command rows is reached.
•  Fixed a bug where dragging and dropping a row to the same location caused it to jump to the top or bottom of the list.
•  Fixed a bug where dragging and dropping or deleting a row sometimes caused the view to scroll to a different location.
•  Fixed a bug where the row menu sometimes didn't register a selection.

Previous version:

•  Redesigned user interface for configuring commands.
•  Drag-and-drop support to reorder commands.
•  Checkbox option to show or hide commands in the drop-down menu.
•  Add and delete commands as needed instead of showing blank rows.
•  Duplicate existing command entries.
•  Increased maximum number of supported commands to 30.
