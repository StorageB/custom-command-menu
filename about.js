Version 11

What's new in this version:

•  Added option to customize menu location in the top bar.
•  Support for GNOME 49.

Previous version:

•  Typing --- or ~~~ in the name field creates a separator line in the menu.
•  Adding text after --- or ~~~ creates a labeled separator.
•  An "Insert new" option was added to the row menu (alongside "Duplicate" and "Delete") to insert a new row below an existing one.
•  A maximize button was added to the preferences window, and the default window size has been changed to better suit a list of commands.
•  A notification will now appear when the maximum number of command rows is reached.
•  Fixed a bug where dragging and dropping a row to the same location caused it to jump to the top or bottom of the list.
•  Fixed a bug where dragging and dropping or deleting a row sometimes caused the view to scroll to a different location.
•  Fixed a bug where the row menu sometimes didn't register a selection.
