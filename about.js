Version 10-beta1

What's new in this version:

•  Added an "Insert new" option to the row menu (alongside "Duplicate" and "Delete") to allow inserting a new row below an existing one.
•  Fixed a bug where dragging and dropping a row to the same location caused it to jump to the top or bottom of the list.
•  Fixed a bug where deleting a row scrolled the view to a different location.
•  Fixed a bug where the row menu sometimes didn't register a selection.
•  Added a notification for when the maximum number of command rows is reached.

Previous version:

•  Redesigned user interface for configuring commands.
•  Drag-and-drop support to reorder commands.
•  Checkbox option to show or hide commands in the drop-down menu.
•  Add and delete commands as needed instead of showing blank rows.
•  Duplicate existing command entries.
•  Increased maximum number of supported commands to 30.
