Version 10-beta2

What's new in this version:

•  Added an "Insert new" option to the row menu (alongside "Duplicate" and "Delete") to allow inserting a new row below an existing one.
•  Added a maximize button to the preferences window and changed the default window size to be more appropriate.
•  A notification will now appear when the maximum number of command rows is reached.
•  Fixed a bug where dragging and dropping a row to the same location caused it to jump to the top or bottom of the list.
•  Fixed a bug where dragging and dropping or deleting a row sometimes caused the view to scroll to a different location.
•  Fixed a bug where the row menu sometimes didn't register a selection.

Previous version:

•  Redesigned user interface for configuring commands.
•  Drag-and-drop support to reorder commands.
•  Checkbox option to show or hide commands in the drop-down menu.
•  Add and delete commands as needed instead of showing blank rows.
•  Duplicate existing command entries.
•  Increased maximum number of supported commands to 30.
