## Configuration

From the extension's preferences, enter the terminal/shell commands to include in the drop-down menu and the associated display name for each command. If the name field is left empty, the command will not appear in the drop-down menu.

For a list of available icons to use:

Alternatively, navigate to the icon directory for your systemâ€™s theme (located at /usr/share/icons), or use the [Icon Library app](https://flathub.org/apps/org.gnome.design.IconLibrary).

Enter the name of the icon without the file extension. Note that icon appearance will vary depending on your systems's theme.

Command tips:
- Run multiple commands by using `&` between commands.
- Chain multiple commands together to run one at a time using `&&` between commands.
- By default, commands do not run in a terminal window and will not show any output or error messages. Test the full command first by running it in the terminal before adding it to the extension to verify it is correct. 
- To run a command in a terminal window, use `gnome-terminal -- command`. Note that by default the GNOME terminal will close after the command is complete, but that can be changed in the terminal preferences if needed.
- Sudo commands require a password input from the terminal, so they will not directly work by themselves since commands run without a terminal window by default. However, you can use `gnome-terminal -- command` to run the command in the terminal. For example, `gnome-terminal -- sudo apt-get update` will open a terminal, prompt for your password, and then run the command.
